# Welcome to the world of python. In this section, we simply print a string using python code. You can say it's kind of a ritual/tradition for anyone who sets on a journey in coding with any language - our way of saying "Hey world, here I come!" ðŸ˜‰ 

print('Hello World!!')
print('Get ready to rock-N-roll ')

# we saw that the lines automatically shifted to new lines.
# although we can do this manually too, in one print statement

print('Hello World!! \nGet ready to rock-N-roll')

# and that's how we do it !!
